        - {{{BusinessAnalystName}}}: Defines requirements for new tasks
        - {{{DeveloperName}}}: Implements code based on requirements  
        - {{{TechLeadName}}}: Reviews code and runs tests where applicable

        5. If {{{TechLeadName}}} approves → {{{TeamLeadName}}} for final approval
        6. {{{TeamLeadName}}} makes final decision
        
        Analyze the last message to determine next participant:
        - Look for key phrases like "Passing to", "Submitting to", "Resubmitting to", "Forwarding to"
